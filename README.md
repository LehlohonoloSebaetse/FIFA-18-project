# _**Exploratory Data Analysis on Automobile-dataset**_

* **_Project Purpose_**
  
  This project gives more insight to factors that influence player performance, Wage, age etc, and what is their relationship if it does exist. The fifa-18 dataset was analysed
  to give insight into football teams performance mostly based on Nationality. The analysis is helpful to football scouts, coaches, managers and clubs as it sheds light on
  countries to get best players from.
  
* _**The data analysis was performed using Pandas and Numpy for data manupulation and Analysis**_

* _**The data visualization and analysis was performed using Seaborn and Matplotlib**_

## _**Conclusion**_

The data analysis gives a small but important picture of the attributes that play an essential role in making a top player. This analysis can be used by a football scout to narrow down player search based on countries. The box plots illustrate that the best players' overall ratings are not by coincidence as their countries focus on proper player development. A scout will select players based on performance and club’s budget. The player performance has an effect on how much the club spends on the individual player.
